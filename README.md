# LifeOps

A single-user, offline-first **weekly operations log** for your life — part task
manager, part time tracker, part honest mirror. You plan a week, do the work, log
the hours, and close the week. Completed work earns **resources**; every week is
permanently recorded as one ring in a **Growth Record** that can't be faked, ground,
or back-dated.

LifeOps is opinionated and a little sardonic. It is not a gentle habit app — it keeps
the receipts.

> **New here?** The full end-user manual is **[docs/USER_GUIDE.md](docs/USER_GUIDE.md)** —
> written for someone who just installed the app and wants to know how to use it.

## What it does

| Screen | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **This Week** | The cockpit. Create tasks, set priority/estimate/due date, log time (timer, Pomodoro, or manual), complete/skip/carry tasks, then **close the week**. |
| **Resources** | RPG-style resource slots that fill as you complete work, mapped from your aspects. |
| **Reports** | Trends: completion rate, aspect balance, time spent, scoring, project health, priority breakdown, resource usage, carryover. |
| **Growth Record** | A permanent, per-week concentric-ring history. One ring per week; effort shows as colour; skipped weeks leave grey scars. |
| **Settings** | Aspects & categories, projects, cost resources, notifications, SMS ingestion, theme, and all backup/export actions. |

### Core concepts

- **Aspect** — a top-level area of life (e.g. *Body*, *Craft*, *Mind*). Has a name and colour.
- **Category** — a sub-grouping inside an aspect.
- **Project** — a longer effort that groups related tasks within an aspect.
- **Week** — Monday→Sunday. The current week is open; you **close** it manually, which
  snapshots it, carries forward what you chose to keep, and starts the next one.
- **Task** — a unit of work with a priority, optional estimate, due date, and logged time.
- **Resource value & scoring** — completing a task earns `resourceValue × accuracy`, where
  accuracy rewards estimating well (see the guide).

## The Growth Record (rings) — design note

Each closed week is drawn as **one concentric ring**, fixed thickness, accumulating
outward from a seed. Bands within a ring are the aspects you spent hours on; colour and
glow encode effort; a zero-hour week is a permanent grey **scar**.

**The one invariant:** *a ring, once drawn, never changes.* Adding week N+1 must not move,
resize, recolour, or restack any earlier ring. Everything is subordinate to that — thickness
is flat (the view zooms, the geometry never does), a ring's radius depends only on the weeks
before it, and colour/track map to a **stable aspect id**, never an array index. The aspect
list is append-only.

To keep history faithful even when an aspect is later **deleted, renamed, or recoloured**,
week-close seals a per-aspect `{minutes, name, colour}` blob into the week snapshot
(`aspectHistory`). Sealed history is immutable; the open week (and any pre-feature week) falls
back to live time-entry derivation. This matters because `tasks.aspectId` is `ON DELETE SET
NULL`, so a live join alone could not survive a deletion.

The render layer emits a **shape-agnostic primitive list** (crisp `fill` + `glow` bands), which
feeds both the on-screen Compose canvas and the **SVG** exporter — so vector export stays a
first-class feature.

## Tech stack

- **Kotlin** + **Jetpack Compose** (Material 3)
- **Room** (SQLite) for persistence, **Gson** for backup/import
- **MVVM**: `Screen` (Compose) → `ViewModel` (`StateFlow`) → `Repository` → `Dao`
- **WorkManager** for reminders, **Glance** for the home-screen widget
- Min SDK 26 · Target/Compile SDK 35 · JDK 11

### Project layout

```

├── data/
│   ├── db/            Room database, entities, DAOs, migrations

```

The **growth** logic lives in pure, Android-free modules so it is unit-testable on the JVM:
`util/GrowthRings.kt` (geometry/scene), `util/GrowthColor.kt` (hex/HSL + intensity),
`util/GrowthData.kt` (assemble live + sealed snapshots), `util/GrowthExport.kt` (CSV + SVG),
`util/Csv.kt` (shared CSV quoting).

## Build & run

The project targets the standard Android toolchain.

**Android Studio (recommended):** open the project root; let it sync; run the `app`
configuration on a device/emulator (API 26+).

**Command line:** you need an Android SDK. Point the build at it via a `local.properties`
with `sdk.dir=/path/to/Android/Sdk` (the checked-in value is a placeholder), or set
`ANDROID_HOME`. Then:

```bash
gradle :app:assembleDebug        # build the debug APK
gradle :app:testDebugUnitTest    # run JVM unit tests
```

> Note: the Gradle wrapper jar/scripts are not committed, so use a locally installed
> `gradle` (8.7+) or Android Studio's bundled Gradle. Running `gradle wrapper` once will
> generate `./gradlew` if you want it.

## Tests

JVM unit tests live in `app/src/test/`. Notable suites:

- `ScoringUtilsTest` — accuracy multiplier.
- `GrowthRingsTest` — band proportions, colour mapping (h = 0/25/50/90), glow bounds,
  **the immutability invariant**, CSV round-trip, SVG export.
- `GrowthDataTest` — sealed-vs-live source selection, stable aspect ordering, and
  `deleteAspect_preservesHistoricalSnapshots`.
- `CsvTest` — CSV quoting/round-trip.

## Data & privacy

LifeOps is **local-only** — there is no backend and nothing leaves your device unless you
explicitly export or share it. Back up regularly from **Settings → Data**:

- **Backup JSON** — the complete, restorable snapshot of everything.
- **Export Tasks CSV** — a flat, spreadsheet-friendly view of every task.
- **Rings CSV / SVG** — the Growth Record as a `week × aspect` hours grid, or a vector image.

Exports are written as plain text (no compression). The JSON is the only format that can
be restored.
